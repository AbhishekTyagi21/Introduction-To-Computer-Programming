The CodeStorm Challenge is an intense coding competition designed to test participants' programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and communication prowess. In this challenge, participants will be required to solve a total of 30 intricate coding questions that cover a wide range of algorithms, data structures, and programming paradigms. Additionally, participants are tasked with creating an explanatory video that delves into the solutions of any five chosen questions.

The challenge aims to evaluate participants on their coding efficiency, algorithmic thinking, and presentation skills. Participants will need to not only implement correct and optimized solutions to the coding problems but also effectively communicate their thought processes and strategies in the form of a video presentation.
